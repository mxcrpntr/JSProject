      <h2><i>What is a word ladder?</i></h2>
      <p>
        Traditionally, a word ladder is a series of words that connect one word to 
        another word by switching one letter at a time. A ladder connecting "APE" to "MAN" 
        might proceed like "APE" => "APT" => "OPT => "OAT" => "MAT" => "MAN", while a 
        ladder connecting "GOOD" to "EVIL" could go "GOOD" => "FOOD" => "FOOL" => ...hmmm... 
        maybe there's not a ladder connecting those...
      </p>
      <h2><i>Why are word ladders interesting?</i></h2>
      <p>
        While they may seem merely like a kid's cereal box challenge, word ladders 
        journey through their respective dictionaries in fascinating ways that buck 
        etymological, definitional, and rhyming connections in favor of modular ones, 
        often to surprising ends. The way our brains try to construct these ladders 
        also mimics the behavior of a breadth-first search through a tree data model: 
        the starting word can be taken to be a root node with its children being all the 
        words that are one letter away from it, and, hopefully, the ending word being one 
        of its descendants.
      </p>

      <p>
        These ladders, modeled like trees, can inadvertently connect vast networks of 
        words within a single dictionary. The inclusion of operations like anagramming 
        and adding or dropping letters can connect even vaster swaths of words. (That is, 
        we couldn't allow for "GOOD" => "MOOD" => "MOLD" => "MILD" => "MILE" => "VILE" => "EVIL" 
        before allowing for anagramming.)
      </p>
      <h2><i>Okay sure. What's this site then?</i></h2>
      <p>
        With the help of a sometimes strange (and very PG) dictionary .txt file 
        and some pretty efficient dictionary traversal algorithms, I have put together a 
        combination word ladder generator and visualizer of sorts. Try it out by putting some 
        regular old words in and seeing if it can connect them, and take a look at the tree 
        it generates when it can (or even sometimes can't) find the shortest possible path between 
        your inputs.

        For this project I made use of d3 code from Mike Bostock's "Tree, Tidy" 
        article on Observable (https://observablehq.com/@d3/tree) and a dictionary 
        text file from App Academy.
